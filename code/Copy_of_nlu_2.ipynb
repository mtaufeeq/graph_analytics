    "Instead of using Wordnet, let's investigate more data-driven approaches to creating representations of meaning for words. John Rupert Firth, a 20th century linguist, inspired this line of work when he said \"You shall know a word by the company it keeps.\" That is, let's try to infer something about semantics from the distributional statistics of how words are used in context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early work on [distributional semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributional_semantics) involved clustering words together with similar distributional statistics. The widely used [Brown clustering algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_clustering), developed at IBM by Peter Brown in the early 1990s, produces a hierarchical clustering directly from data with some similarity to the Wordnet hierarchy produced by hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we'll take a step past clusters and start exploring **word embeddings** -- learned mappings of words to continuous vectors. Embedding space allows us to compute the distance between words (in Euclidean space) while preserving the nuance that differentiates synonyms (this nuance is lost in a clustering). Embeddings directly address the sparsity problem with language -- rather than parameterize all of the language with a sparse set of atomic words (or word n-grams), we parameterize it in a single, shared, fairly low dimensional space -- say 100 dimensions. So instead of a million words, we have 100 semantic axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook starts to address the problem of learning a mapping from words to vectors, an idea that has become the foundation to just about all modern NLU. At a high level, we'll achieve this by estimating vectors for each word that allow us to reconstruct a large matrix of co-occurrence counts across a corpus."

    "We need a corpus of text for our experiments. We'll start with the [bAbI corpus](https://research.fb.com/downloads/babi/), a list of simple sentences (generated from a template) with a very small vocabulary. The number of word **tokens** (strings of characters or punctuation delimited by white space or newline) is over 1 million, but the number of word **types** (the vocabulary) is only 162. This corpus makes it easy to verify that our learned embeddings are reasonable, but it's not representative of the tremendous variation and large vocabularies in natural language.\n",

    "## Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "We've shown that we can use simple co-occurrences in a text corpus and SVD to create dense embeddings -- representations for words that appear to preserve some of our intuitions about word similarities. A few questions naturally come to mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Is there some way to *interpret* each dimension of the embeddings?**\n",
    "Well, no, not really. Because the embeddings arise solely from their distributional properties, we can't guarantee that each dimension will correspond to some intuitive concept. Of course you could try to examine the 2-D plot (not the t-SNE one) and see if you can find an explanation for the first two components -- the $x$ and $y$ axes. Note that some social science disciplines like psychology have used **Factor Analysis** to attempt to rotate embeddings into a pre-defined space with psychological concepts on the axes. But typically in language processing, we simply relinquish control over the inferred semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **How do we evaluate how *good* the embeddings are?**\n",
    "Evaluation typically comes in two forms: **intrinsic** and **extrinsic**. Intrinsic evaluation attempts to quantify the quality of the embeddings themselves. A few different annotation projects have attempted to score semantic similarity between pairs of words by averaging human judgements (e.g. see [ConceptSim](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~hansens/conceptSim/)). So we could ask how well distances between our word embeddings correlate with human judgements. Another related evaluation involves analogies. Can we use Euclidean distances in embeddings space to solve fill-in-the-blanks like: `[man::woman as king::_____]`, which can capture various kinds of syntactic and semantic relationships? See [Chen, Peterson, Griffiths, 2017](https://cocosci.berkeley.edu/papers/vector_space_analogy_cogsci2017_final.pdf) for a lot more details and a cognitive science perspective. By contrast, extrinsic evaluation involves plugging the embeddings into another task and measuring relative improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "As it turns out, the co-occurrence plus SVD method is simple, but inferior with respect to both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation. The Word2Vec ideas introduced in the next notebook revolutionized language processing by dramatically improving embeddings."

    "`[\"john\", \"kitchen\", \"give\", \"mouse\", \"she\", \"blue\"]`. Do the results look reasonable? Is this intrinsic or extrinsic evaluation?\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Train your embeddings using a real corpus of text. This could be some text you have access to, e.g. some text from Wikipedia, or Shakespeare. You just need to load a corpus of sentences, which you can do by specifying its pathname as the first argument to the BabiTaskCorpusReader function."
